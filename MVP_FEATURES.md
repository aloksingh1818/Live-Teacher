## Assumptions & Constraints
- MVP is mobile-first (Flutter), backend in Python (FastAPI)
- Only local PDF upload and storage for MVP
- TTS uses third-party APIs (Google/Amazon)
- OCR for scanned PDFs is basic, not advanced handwriting
- Authentication uses Firebase Auth (or similar)

## Next Steps
- Review and confirm this checklist with stakeholders
- Create user stories and tasks for each feature
- Begin technical design and implementation
